# BACKGROUND STUDY AND LITERATURE REVIEW
## 2.1 Background Study
Social media platforms have become an integral part of modern communication and interaction. Social media platforms have undergone a remarkable transformation since their inception, evolving from rudimentary message boards into intricate tools that connect billions of people worldwide. Today, these platforms play a pivotal role in shaping our lives, facilitating information sharing, and fostering global interactions. 

The roots of social media can be traced back to the 1980s with the emergence of bulletin board systems (BBS). These early online communities provided a space for users to post messages, exchange ideas, and engage in discussions, laying the groundwork for the interactive and interconnected social media landscape that people know today. 
The late 1990s and early 2000s marked a significant turning point in the evolution of social media, with the rise of platforms like Six Degrees, MySpace, and Friendster. These platforms shifted the focus from purely online communication to fostering social connections and content sharing. Users could create profiles, share photos and videos, and connect with friends and family, paving the way for a more personalized and engaging social media experience. 
A pivotal moment arrived with the advent of Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s, which introduced user-generated content and social networking APIs. This technological leap empowered individuals to become active participants in shaping the online landscape, creating and sharing their own content, and connecting with others on a broader scale. The rise of giants like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube further revolutionized social media, transforming communication patterns and fostering global connectivity. 

Today, social media platforms have become indispensable tools for communication, information sharing, and social interaction. They have permeated nearly every aspect of our lives, from personal connections to business operations, news consumption, and entertainment. These platforms have transformed how people connect with friends and family, access information, and engage with the world around us. 

However, the rapid evolution of social media has also brought about challenges and concerns. The spread of misinformation, the potential for cyberbullying and harassment, and the addictive nature of social media platforms are just a few of the issues that need to be addressed. As social media continues to evolve, it is crucial to find ways to harness its power for good while mitigating its potential negative impacts. The future of social media remains uncertain, but it is clear that these platforms will continue to play a significant role in our lives. As technology advances and new platforms emerge, social media will undoubtedly adapt to meet the changing needs and preferences of users. The key lies in ensuring that social media remains a force for positive connection, informed engagement, and responsible use.

## 2.2 Literature Review
Facebook, with over 2.9 billion active users, is a prominent social media platform that has a significant impact on society. While its features enable users to connect with friends and family, build social capital, and gain knowledge, it also raises concerns about social comparison, cyberbullying, and privacy. The platform's privacy policies, in particular, have drawn criticism. Further research is essential to fully comprehend Facebook's societal impact[1].

WhatsApp is a popular messaging application with over 2 billion users worldwide. It is known for its ease of use, affordability, and ability to connect people across geographical distances. The app's simple and intuitive interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users, while its free voice and text messaging capabilities eliminate the need for expensive phone calls or SMS charges. WhatsApp's global reach enables users to connect with friends, family, and colleagues regardless of their location, and its cross-platform compatibility allows seamless communication across various devices. Additionally, WhatsApp facilitates the creation of closed groups for private conversations, and supports the sharing of various multimedia content, including photos, videos, documents, and voice messages. These features have contributed to WhatsApp's immense popularity and widespread adoption[2].

#### • Javascript
Javascript is used in our project to call the function, action in button, add event in project.
#### • Php
Php is used to run the backend of the program. It is used to optimise the code, connect database with code etc.
#### Database platform
#### • MySQLDatabase
Mysql database is used to store data, retrive and display data request by user.

### 4.1.2 Implementation Details of Modules
The proposed system is composed of different modules such as login module, messenging module, newsfeed module, etc. Implementation applicatin of this scale requires lot of resource and explaining the whole implantation process will not be clarified. So some of the modules are listed below.
#### • Login Module
The database verifies the login credentials and redirect to home page.

```php
$loginQuery = $mysql->prepare("select * from users where username=? and password=? and approved_status='1'");
$loginQuery->bind_param("ss", $username, $md5password);
$loginQuery->execute();
$loginQuery->store_result();

if($loginQuery->num_rows > 0){
    session_start();
    $_SESSION["username"] = $_POST["username"];

    $updateOnline = $mysql->prepare("update users set online_status = '1' where username = ?");
    $updateOnline->bind_param("s", $username);
    $updateOnline->execute();

    
    header("Location: ./index.php");
}
```

#### • Register Module
All the data entered in the form are stored in database for login verification process. Before registering the value, username, email, phone number are checked in database to prevent duplicate entry in database. If not found, data are registered in database as well as RSA 4096 key are generated in this module for sending and receiving encrypted text message each for different users.

```php
if(isset($_POST['register'])){
    if (isset($_FILES['profile']['error']) && $_FILES['profile']['error']== 0 ) {
        if (isset($_FILES['profile']['size']) && $_FILES['profile']['size'] < 4000000) {
            $file_types = ['image/jpeg','image/png','image/jpg'];
            if (in_array($_FILES['profile']['type'], $file_types)) {
                //chmod('images', 0777);
                echo  $pname = uniqid() . '_' . $_FILES['profile']['name'];
                if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['profile']['tmp_name'], 'profile/' .$pname )) {

    }
    else{
        echo "<script>alert('register failed');</script>";
    }
}
```

#### • Friend Request Module
This module stores the data of two users id with the friend relation flags value. The two flags value helps to clarify the friends of the users. When a user send request to another user, user id of user 1 and user 2 is uploaded in friendlist table with friend_approve_1 and friend_approve_2 value 1 and 0 respectively. This confirms the sender of friend request to next users.

```php
if(isset($_POST["btn-add"]) == "Add Friend"){
    // echo "<script> alert('lol'); </script>";
    $query_add_friend_request = $mysql->prepare("insert into friend_lists (friend_id_1 , friend_id_2, friend_approve_1, friend_approve_2) values (?,?,?,?);");
			
    $query_add_friend_request->bind_param("iiii", $sess_uid, $_POST["add_friend_value"], $flag_value_1, $flag_value_0);
    
    $query_add_friend_request->execute();
}

```

#### • Accept Friend Request Module
As user get request from another user, second user has to set friend_approve_2 value 1 to accept friend request. When user accept request, friends are displayed in friendlist.

```php
if(isset($_POST["btn-accept"]) == "Accept"){
    $query_accept_friend_request = $mysql->prepare("update friend_lists set friend_approve_2 = ? where friend_id_1 = ? and friend_id_2 = ?;");
			
    $query_accept_friend_request->bind_param("iii", $flag_value_1, $_POST["friend_request_value"], $sess_uid);
    
    $query_accept_friend_request->execute();
}
```

#### • Friend List Module
Friend List module shows the list of friend of user. When user accept the request as friend_approve_1 and friend_approve_2 value 1 and 1 respectively, user can sent message to another user.

```php
$query_friend_list = $mysql->query("select * from friend_lists where (friend_id_1 = $sess_uid or friend_id_2 = $sess_uid) and (friend_approve_1 = 1 and friend_approve_2 = 1);");
while($row = $query_friend_list->fetch_assoc()){
    $friend_id_1 = $row["friend_id_1"];
    $friend_id_2 = $row["friend_id_2"];
    $approve_friend_1 = $row["approve_friend_1"];
    $approve_friend_2 = $row["approve_friend_2"];

    
    
    if($sess_uid == $friend_id_1){
        // echo $friend_id_2;
        
        $query_query_friend_list = $mysql->query("select * from users where (approved_status = 1 and id = $friend_id_2) $search_option_query;");
        while($row = $query_query_friend_list->fetch_assoc()){
            echo "<form method='post'>";
            $friendchat_uid = $row["id"];
            $friendchat_uname = $row["username"];

        }
        
    }
}
```

#### • Unfriend Module
User can unfriend other user. When user pressed unfriend, the data of friend list is deleted of user id of user1 and user2 combined.

```php
if(isset($_POST["btn-unfriend2"]) == "Unfriend"){
    $query_unfriend_friend_list = $mysql->prepare("delete from friend_lists where (friend_id_1 = ? and friend_id_2 = ?);");
			
    $query_unfriend_friend_list->bind_param("ii", $_POST["friend_list_value"], $sess_uid);
    
    $query_unfriend_friend_list->execute();
}
```

#### • Newsfeed Module
Newsfeeds are defined with primary key n_id, foreign key user_id that helps to clarify the uploader by user. The newsfeed has comment, likes and dislike defined by primary key id and foreign key newsfeed_id and user_id with content.

```php
if (isset($_POST["whats_your_mind_btn"]) && $_POST["whats_your_mind_btn"] == "upload") {
    // echo "<script> alert('lol');</script>";

    if (isset($_FILES['newsfeed_image']['error']) && $_FILES['newsfeed_image']['error'] == 0) {
        if (isset($_FILES['newsfeed_image']['size']) && $_FILES['newsfeed_image']['size'] < 4000000) {
            $file_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/jpg'];
            if (in_array($_FILES['newsfeed_image']['type'], $file_types)) {
                //chmod('images', 0777);
                $pname = uniqid() . '_' . $_FILES['newsfeed_image']['name'];
                if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['newsfeed_image']['tmp_name'], 'newsfeed/' . $pname)) {
                    echo 'Success';
                    $flag_image_newsfeed = 1;
                } else {
                    echo 'Image upload failed';
                }
            } else {
                echo 'Image type mismatch';
            }
        } else {
            echo 'Image size exceed';
        }
    } else {
        echo 'Please upload image';
    }

    if ($flag_image_newsfeed != 1) {
        $pname = 0;
    }

    $newsfeed_upload = $mysql->prepare("insert into newsfeed(user_id, username, user_profile, newsfeed, image)values (?,?,?,?,?);");

    $newsfeed_upload->bind_param("issss", $sess_uid, $sess_Username, $me_profile, $_POST["whats_your_mind"], $pname);

    $newsfeed_upload->execute();
}
```

#### • Story Module
User who uploads the story are stored until for next 24 hours. The story will be seen by users who have accepted the friend requests.

```php
$flag = 0;
if(isset($_POST['post_story'])){
    if (isset($_FILES['img_story']['error']) && $_FILES['img_story']['error']== 0 ) {
        if (isset($_FILES['img_story']['size']) && $_FILES['img_story']['size'] < 4000000) {
            $file_types = ['image/jpeg','image/png','image/jpg'];
            if (in_array($_FILES['img_story']['type'], $file_types)) {
                //chmod('images', 0777);
                echo  $pname = uniqid() . '_' . $_FILES['img_story']['name'];
                if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['img_story']['tmp_name'], 'story/' .$pname )) {
                    // echo 'Success';
                    $flag = 1;
                } 
                else {
                    echo 'Image upload failed';
                }
            } 
            else {
                $err['img_story'] = 'Image type mismatch';
            }
        } 
        else {
            $err['img_story'] = 'Image size exceed';
        }
    } 
    else {
        $err['img_story'] = 'Please upload image';
    }

    if($flag == 1){
        date_default_timezone_set("Asia/Kathmandu");
        $date = date("Y-m-d");
        $time = date("H:i:s");
        $query_story = $mysql->prepare("insert into story(user_id, username, user_profile, story_img, date, time)values (?,?,?,?,?,?);");
        
        $query_story->bind_param("ssssss",$me_uid, $me_username, $me_profile, $pname,$date,$time);
        
        $query_story->execute();
        echo "<script>alert('story');</script>";
        header("location: index.php");

    }
}
```

#### • Message Module
The message are sent from users to users with sender id and receiving id with message content. The message are encrypted with public key and decrypted with private key that helps in privacy. As the message texts are compared with toxic word stored in text file with regex are matched, the text are shown with asterisk \'\*\'.

```php
if(isset($_POST["send"])){
    if (isset($_FILES['image']['error']) && $_FILES['image']['error']== 0 ) {
        if (isset($_FILES['image']['size']) && $_FILES['image']['size'] < 4000000) {
            $file_types = ['image/jpeg','image/png','image/jpg'];
            if (in_array($_FILES['image']['type'], $file_types)) {
                //chmod('images', 0777);
                    $pname = uniqid() . '_' . $_FILES['image']['name'];
                if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], 'message/' .$pname )) {
                    echo 'Success';
                } 
                else {
                    echo 'Image upload failed';
                }
            } 
            else {
                $err['image'] = 'Image type mismatch';
            }
        } 
        else {
            $err['image'] = 'Image size exceed';
        }
    } 
    else {
        $err['image'] = 'Please upload image';
    }

    if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"]=="POST"){
        $message_flag = 1;

        // RSA Encrypted
        $text_message = $_POST["text"];
        $encoded_encrypted = "";
        if($text_message != ""){
            openssl_public_encrypt($text_message, $encrypted, $receiver_public_key);
            $encoded_encrypted = base64_encode($encrypted);
        }			
        
        $registerQuery = $mysql->prepare("insert into messages(date, time, sender_id, receiver_id, sender, message, image, message_unread, message_counter)values (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?);");
        
        $registerQuery->bind_param("sssssssii",date("Y-m-d"), date("h:i:s a"),$sess_uid,$receiver_id,$sess_Username,$encoded_encrypted,$pname,$message_flag,$message_flag);
        
        $registerQuery->execute();
    }

}
```

#### • Message Encryption Module
Firstly, RSA-4096 Asymmetric keys are generated in registration of accounts that are stored in users table. The message text are encrypted by receiver public key and stored in message table. The encrypted text are decrypted by receiver private key which can be read by receiver.

```php
if($message1 != ""){
    if($messagesender == $sess_Username){
        $decoded_encrypted = base64_decode($message1);
        openssl_private_decrypt($decoded_encrypted, $decrypted_message, $receiver_private_key);
        $message1 = $decrypted_message;	
    }
    else{
        $decoded_encrypted = base64_decode($message1);
        openssl_private_decrypt($decoded_encrypted, $decrypted_message, $sender_private_key);
        $message1 = $decrypted_message;	
    }
}
```
